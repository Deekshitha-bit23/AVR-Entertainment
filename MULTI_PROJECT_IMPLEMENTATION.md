# Multi-Project Access and Management Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of multi-project access and management functionality for the AVR Entertainment Expense Management System. The system now supports project-based access control, user assignments, and project creation capabilities.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Project Selection Landing Page
- **New Navigation Flow**: Login ‚Üí Project Selection ‚Üí Role-specific Project Home
- **User-specific Project Access**: Users only see projects they're assigned to
- **Beautiful Project Cards**: Display project details, budget, status, and user role
- **Loading States**: Proper loading and error handling

### 2. Project Creation for Approvers/Admins
- **Floating Action Button**: "+" button in bottom-right corner for authorized users
- **Comprehensive Form**: Project name, description, budget, start/end dates
- **Auto-assignment**: Creator becomes manager and approver automatically
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Success Feedback**: Clear success messages and navigation

### 3. Role-based Project Access Control
- **USER**: Can access projects where they are team members
- **APPROVER**: Can access projects where they are approvers, team members, or managers
- **ADMIN**: Can access all active projects (full access)

### 4. Enhanced Models and Backend

#### Updated User Model
```kotlin
data class User(
    val phoneNumber: String = "",
    val role: UserRole? = null,
    val assignedProjects: List<String> = emptyList(), // Project IDs
    val createdBy: String = "",
    val timestamp: Timestamp = Timestamp.now()
)

enum class UserRole {
    USER,
    APPROVER,
    ADMIN  // New role added
}
```

#### Enhanced Project Model
```kotlin
data class Project(
    val id: String = "",
    val name: String = "",
    val description: String = "",
    val budget: Double = 0.0,
    val startDate: String = "",
    val endDate: String = "",
    val status: ProjectStatus = ProjectStatus.ACTIVE,
    val managerId: String = "",
    val teamMembers: List<String> = emptyList(), // User IDs
    val approvers: List<String> = emptyList(), // Approver IDs
    val createdBy: String = "",
    val createdAt: Timestamp = Timestamp.now(),
    val updatedAt: Timestamp = Timestamp.now()
)
```

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### New Repository Methods

#### ProjectRepository Enhancements
- `getUserAccessibleProjects(userId, userRole)`: Filter projects based on user access
- `createProject(...)`: Create new projects with proper assignments
- `assignUsersToProject(...)`: Assign users and approvers to projects
- Enhanced default project creation with user assignments

#### Sample User Data
- **USER**: `+919876543210`, `+917654321098`
- **APPROVER**: `+918765432109`
- **ADMIN**: `+919999999999`

### Navigation Updates
- **Project Selection Screen**: `project_selection`
- **Create Project Screen**: `create_project`
- **Project-specific Home Screens**: 
  - `team_home/{projectId}`
  - `approver_home/{projectId}`

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Project Selection Screen
- **Clean Interface**: Modern card-based layout
- **Project Information**: Name, description, budget, status, user role
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for project status
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no projects are available
- **Error Handling**: Retry functionality for failed loads

### Create Project Screen
- **Step-by-step Form**: Intuitive project creation flow
- **Date Pickers**: Easy date selection for project timeline
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation and error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation messages
- **Help Tips**: Guidance for project creation

### Updated Home Screens
- **Project Context**: Display current project name in headers
- **Project-specific Data**: All expenses and data scoped to selected project
- **Back Navigation**: Return to project selection screen

## üîí Security and Access Control

### Project Access Matrix
| Role | Can View | Can Create | Can Assign Users | Can Access All |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| USER | Assigned Projects | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| APPROVER | Assigned + Managed Projects | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| ADMIN | All Projects | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### Backend Security
- **User Validation**: Verify user roles before granting access
- **Project Filtering**: Server-side filtering based on user assignments
- **Creation Permissions**: Only approvers and admins can create projects
- **Auto-assignment**: Creators automatically get appropriate access

## üì± User Experience Flow

### For Team Members (USER)
1. Login ‚Üí Project Selection
2. View assigned projects only
3. Select project ‚Üí Team Home with project context
4. Create expenses for selected project

### For Approvers (APPROVER)
1. Login ‚Üí Project Selection
2. View projects they manage/approve
3. **Create new projects** using "+" button
4. Select project ‚Üí Approver Home with project context
5. Review expenses for selected project

### For Admins (ADMIN)
1. Login ‚Üí Project Selection
2. View all active projects
3. **Create new projects** using "+" button
4. Full access to all project management features
5. Can assign users to projects (backend functionality)

## üöÄ Backend Assignment Capabilities

### Admin Project Assignment
- **Assign Team Members**: Add users to project team members list
- **Assign Approvers**: Add approvers to project approvers list
- **Modify Access**: Update user assignments as needed
- **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple users at once

### Example Assignment API Usage
```kotlin
// Assign users to a project
projectRepository.assignUsersToProject(
    projectId = "project123",
    userIds = listOf("+919876543210", "+917654321098"),
    approverIds = listOf("+918765432109"),
    assignedBy = "admin_user_id"
)
```
