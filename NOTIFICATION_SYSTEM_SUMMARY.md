## 🚀 **AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS**

### 1. **Real-time Expense Processing**
- **Expense Submission** → Approver gets "New Expense Submitted"
- **Expense Approval** → User gets "Expense Approved" + Budget check
- **Expense Rejection** → User gets "Expense Rejected"

### 2. **Budget Monitoring (Every 30 seconds)**
- **Budget Exceeded Check** → All team members get budget exceeded alerts
- **Duplicate Prevention** → 30-minute cooldown between similar alerts

### 3. **Pending Approval Monitoring (Every 30 seconds)**
- **Multiple Pending** → Approvers get reminder for projects with >1 pending expense
- **Old Expenses** → Approvers get reminder for expenses >6 hours old

### 4. **Smart Notification Management**
- **Role Filtering** → Users only see relevant notification types
- **Duplicate Prevention** → Same notifications not sent multiple times
- **Consolidation** → Multiple similar alerts combined into one

## 🧪 **TESTING INTERFACE**

You can test all notification types using the built-in simulation methods:

### In MainActivity.kt:
```kotlin
// Test all notification types
testAllNotificationTypes()

// Test specific types:
simulateBudgetChange("project1", "Movie Production A", "Costumes", 25000.0, "added")
simulateProjectBudgetChange("project1", "Movie Production A", 100000.0, "added") 
simulateBudgetExceeded("project1", "Movie Production A", "Camera", false)
simulatePendingApprovalReminder("project1", "Movie Production A", 5, 75000.0)
```
