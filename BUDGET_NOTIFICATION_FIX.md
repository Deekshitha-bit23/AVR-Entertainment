# Budget Exceeded Notification Fix - Implementation

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue of too many duplicate "Budget Exceeded" notifications flooding the notification panel, which was overwhelming users with repetitive alerts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Cleanup of Duplicate Notifications**
- **Before creating new budget exceeded notifications**, the system now automatically deletes old ones for the same project/department
- **One-time cleanup** runs on app startup to remove existing duplicates
- **Smart grouping** by recipient, project, department, and notification type

### 2. **Prevention of Spam Notifications**
- **5% threshold**: Budget exceeded notifications only trigger when spending exceeds budget by more than 5%
- **Significant excess check**: Prevents notifications for minor budget overruns
- **Single notification per department**: Only one active budget exceeded notification per department/project

### 3. **Improved Sample Data**
- **Reduced sample notifications**: Only one budget exceeded notification in test data
- **Variety of notification types**: Balanced mix of approvals, rejections, budget changes
- **Realistic scenarios**: More practical notification examples

## Technical Implementation

### Key Methods Added:

#### `clearOldBudgetExceededNotifications()`
```kotlin
// Automatically deletes old budget exceeded notifications before creating new ones
// Matches by: recipient + project + department + notification type
```

#### `cleanupDuplicateBudgetNotifications()`
```kotlin
// One-time cleanup of existing duplicate notifications
// Keeps only the most recent notification in each group
// Runs automatically on app startup
```

#### Enhanced Budget Monitoring
```kotlin
// Only triggers notifications when budget exceeded by >5%
val significantExcess = budgetLimit * 0.05
if (spent > budgetLimit + significantExcess) {
    // Send notification
}
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix:
```
Budget: â‚¹100,000 | Spent: â‚¹101,000 â†’ Notification
Budget: â‚¹100,000 | Spent: â‚¹102,000 â†’ Another Notification  
Budget: â‚¹100,000 | Spent: â‚¹103,000 â†’ Another Notification
... (Multiple notifications for same department)
```

### After Fix:
```
Budget: â‚¹100,000 | Spent: â‚¹105,000+ â†’ Single Notification
(Previous notifications automatically deleted)
Budget: â‚¹100,000 | Spent: â‚¹110,000 â†’ Updated Notification
(Old notification replaced with current status)
```
