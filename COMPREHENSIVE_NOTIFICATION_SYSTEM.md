# AVR Entertainment - Comprehensive Notification System

## Overview
Complete role-specific notification system implemented for AVR Entertainment's expense management app. The system provides targeted notifications based on user roles and ensures all stakeholders receive relevant information at the right time.

## Role-Based Notification Distribution

### üë§ USER Role Notifications
Users (team members who submit expenses) receive notifications about:

1. **Expense Approval/Rejection Alerts**
   - ‚úÖ `EXPENSE_APPROVED`: "Your ‚ÇπX expense for [Project] has been approved by [Approver]"
   - ‚ùå `EXPENSE_REJECTED`: "Your ‚ÇπX expense for [Project] has been rejected by [Approver]"

2. **Budget Change Notifications**
   - üí∞ `BUDGET_ADDED`: "‚ÇπX has been added to [Department] budget for [Project]"
   - üí∏ `BUDGET_DEDUCTED`: "‚ÇπX has been deducted from [Department] budget for [Project]"
   - üìä Both project-wise and department-wise budget changes

3. **Budget Exceeded Alerts**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `BUDGET_EXCEEDED_DEPARTMENT`: "[Department] budget exceeded by ‚ÇπX"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `BUDGET_EXCEEDED_PROJECT`: "[Project] budget exceeded by ‚ÇπX"

### üë®‚Äçüíº APPROVER Role Notifications
Approvers receive notifications about:

1. **Pending Approval Alerts (Project-wise)**
   - üîî `EXPENSE_SUBMITTED`: "‚ÇπX expense for [Project] needs approval"
   - ‚è∞ `PENDING_APPROVAL_REMINDER`: "X expenses (‚ÇπY total) awaiting approval for [Project]"
   - Detailed breakdown of top pending expenses

2. **Budget Exceeded Alerts (Both Roles)**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `BUDGET_EXCEEDED_DEPARTMENT`: Department-level budget overruns
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `BUDGET_EXCEEDED_PROJECT`: Project-level budget overruns

3. **Budget Change Notifications**
   - üí∞ `BUDGET_ADDED`: Budget increases for oversight
   - üí∏ `BUDGET_DEDUCTED`: Budget reductions for planning

## System Features

### Smart Notification Management
1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple notifications for same event

## System Architecture

### 1. Notification Types (Complete Enum)
```kotlin
enum class NotificationType {
    // Expense related
    EXPENSE_SUBMITTED,      // To approvers when new expense submitted
    EXPENSE_APPROVED,       // To users when expense approved
    EXPENSE_REJECTED,       // To users when expense rejected
    
    // Budget related
    BUDGET_ADDED,           // To all when budget increased
    BUDGET_DEDUCTED,        // To all when budget decreased
    BUDGET_EXCEEDED_PROJECT,    // To all when project budget exceeded
    BUDGET_EXCEEDED_DEPARTMENT, // To all when department budget exceeded
    
    // Approval related
    PENDING_APPROVAL_REMINDER   // To approvers for pending items
}
```

### 2. Notification Data Model
```kotlin
data class NotificationData(
    val id: String = "",
    val title: String = "",
    val message: String = "",
    val type: NotificationType = NotificationType.EXPENSE_SUBMITTED,
    val recipientId: String = "",
    val senderId: String = "",
    val expenseId: String? = null,
    val projectId: String? = null,
    val departmentId: String? = null,
    val budgetId: String? = null,
    val amount: Double? = null,
    val isRead: Boolean = false,
    val createdAt: Timestamp = Timestamp.now()
)
```

### 3. Core Notification Methods

#### Budget Change Notifications
- **Recipients**: Both Users and Approvers
- **Triggers**: Budget modifications (manual or system-generated)
- **Scope**: Project-level and Department-level
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of budget changes

#### Expense Status Notifications
- **Recipients**: Users (expense submitters only)
- **Triggers**: Approval/rejection actions by approvers
- **Features**: Duplicate prevention, detailed logging
- **Push Notifications**: Simulated push notifications with local display

#### Pending Approval Reminders
- **Recipients**: Approvers only
- **Triggers**: Multiple pending expenses or expenses older than 6 hours
- **Features**: Expense breakdown, project-wise grouping
- **Smart Filtering**: Only sends when action is needed

#### Budget Exceeded Alerts
- **Recipients**: Both Users and Approvers
- **Triggers**: Spending exceeds budget limits (with 5% threshold to prevent spam)

- **Scope**: Both project and department level monitoring

### 4. Notification Orchestrator System

The `sendRoleSpecificNotifications()` method provides centralized notification management:

```kotlin
suspend fun sendRoleSpecificNotifications(
    notificationType: NotificationType,
    projectId: String,
    projectName: String,
    department: String? = null,
    amount: Double? = null,
    expenseId: String? = null,
    senderId: String = "system",
    additionalData: Map<String, Any> = emptyMap()
): Result<Unit>
```

### 5. Role-Based Filtering

The system automatically filters notifications based on user roles:

- **Users**: See approval results, budget changes, and budget alerts
- **Approvers**: See pending submissions, approval reminders, budget changes, and budget alerts
