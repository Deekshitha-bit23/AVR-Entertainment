# Notification Display Limit - Implementation Update

## Overview
Updated the notification dropdown panels in both User and Approver screens to display a maximum of 3-4 notifications instead of showing all notifications at once.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Notification Panel (TeamMemberHomeScreen)
- **Limit**: Shows maximum 4 notifications
- **Enhancement**: Added "+X more notifications" indicator when there are more than 4 notifications
- **Display**: Shows most recent notifications first (sorted by timestamp)

**Code Changes:**
```kotlin
// Show only the first 4 notifications
userNotifications.take(4).forEach { notification ->
    // Display notification item
}

// Show count if there are more notifications
if (userNotifications.size > 4) {
    Text("+${userNotifications.size - 4} more notifications")
}
```

### 2. Approver Notification Panel (ApproverHomeScreen)
- **Limit**: Shows maximum 3 individual expense notifications + 1 summary notification
- **Enhancement**: Summary notification shows total count and "+X more pending" when applicable
- **Display**: Only shows PENDING expenses for approvers

**Code Changes:**
```kotlin
// Only show PENDING expenses for approvers (limit to 3 individual notifications)
val pendingExpenses = recentExpenses.filter { it.status == ExpenseStatus.PENDING }

pendingExpenses.take(3).forEach { expense ->
    // Display individual expense notification
}

// Show total pending count as the 4th item
NotificationItem(
    title = "$pendingCount expenses pending review",
    description = if (pendingCount > 3) "+${pendingCount - 3} more pending" else "Total pending",
    time = "Today"
)
```

### 3. Sample Notifications for Testing
Created 6 sample notifications for testing the limit functionality:

1. **Expense Approved** - â‚¹5,000 for Movie Production A
2. **Budget Added** - â‚¹25,000 to Costumes budget
3. **Expense Rejected** - â‚¹2,500 for Documentary Project
4. **Budget Exceeded** - Set Design department over budget
5. **Expense Approved** - â‚¹1,200 for Commercial Ads
6. **Budget Deducted** - â‚¹10,000 from Equipment budget

## Visual Improvements

### User Notifications:
- Shows 4 most recent notifications
- Displays "+2 more notifications" text when there are 6 total notifications
- Maintains clean, uncluttered interface
- Easy to scan important recent updates

### Approver Notifications:
- Shows 3 most recent pending expenses individually
- Shows summary with total pending count
- Indicates additional pending items with "+X more pending"
- Focuses on actionable items requiring approval

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Prevents overwhelming dropdown with too many notifications
2. **Performance**: Faster rendering with limited items
3. **Focus**: Highlights most recent/important notifications
4. **Scalability**: Works well even with hundreds of notifications
5. **Clarity**: Clear indication when more notifications exist

## Testing Scenarios

### To Test User Notification Limit:
1. Login with phone number: `9876543210` (USER role)
2. Click notification bell icon
3. Should see maximum 4 notifications
4. If 6 sample notifications exist, should show "+2 more notifications"

### To Test Approver Notification Limit:
1. Login with phone number: `8765432109` (APPROVER role)
2. Click notification bell icon
3. Should see maximum 3 individual pending expenses
4. Should see summary notification with total count

## Technical Details

### Imports Added:
```kotlin
import androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontStyle
```

### Key Functions:
- `userNotifications.take(4)` - Limits user notifications
- `pendingExpenses.take(3)` - Limits approver expense notifications
- Dynamic count display for remaining notifications

### Sample Data:
- Automatically creates 6 sample notifications on app startup
- Only creates if notifications don't already exist
- Uses realistic expense approval/rejection scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **"View All" Navigation**: Implement full notifications screen
2. **Mark as Read**: Add functionality to mark notifications as read
3. **Priority Sorting**: Show high-priority notifications first
4. **Customizable Limits**: Allow users to set their preferred notification count
5. **Categories**: Group notifications by type (approvals, budgets, etc.)

The notification system now provides a clean, focused experience while ensuring users don't miss important updates! ðŸ””
